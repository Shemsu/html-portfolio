<h1>The Best Movies According to Leslie Grant.</h1>
<h2>3 of my favourite movies.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The God Father</h3>
<p>This series of movies were captivating especially for the time in which they were made. Each one of the movies in this franchise were riveting despite being longer than your average movie.</p> 
<h3>Jason Borne Franchise</h3>
<p>This series was one of my absolute favourite action movies which actually had a great story line. The franchise was more than a simple action movie as the character and storyline linked his past, present & future masterfully</p>
<h3>The Big Short</h3>
<p>This movie highlighted the reasons and events that took place prior and during the 2008 property market crash.</p>
